DNA metabarcoding of gut contents, specifically COI gene on mitochondrial gene

Need to match sequences to known database from Smithsonian Institution

Start with saw sequences
Remove primer sequences
Inspect read quality
Filter and Trim
Error Model
Inference of true Biologial sequence variability (ASVs)
Assign taxomony
End point will be sequences with taxonomic ID, preferably down to species and with Lionfish reads removed
