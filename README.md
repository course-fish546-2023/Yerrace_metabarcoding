# Yerrace_metabarcoding
DNA metabarcoding of gut contents, specifically COI gene on mitochondrial gene

https://rpubs.com/Scuba-Sarah/week_07


Need to match sequences to known database from Smithsonian Institution


- Start with saw sequences
- Remove primer sequences
- Inspect read quality
- Filter and Trim
- Error Model
- Inference of true Biologial sequence variability (ASVs)
- Assign taxomony
- End point will be sequences with taxonomic ID, preferably down to species and with Lionfish reads removed
